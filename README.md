## NillionNetwork

Nillion is a secure computation network that decentralizes trust for high value data in the same way that blockchains decentralized transactions.

# Nillion x Personalized AI
1. A truly personalized AI has access to “level 3” data, allowing it to mimic an individual’s behavior, preferences, and manner of speech, whereas ChatGPT provides generalized responses.
2. A truly personalized AI
3. It exposes highly sensitive information to potential breaches.
4. Data privacy concerns due to centralized control.

# Blind Computation
1. A struggle to protect personal data from being exploited by third parties.
2. Transfer of data to 3 parties
3. It enables data to be processed without exposing it, thus protecting personal privacy.
4. Data is masked, split among multiple nodes, processed without being seen, and then reassembled.

# The Orchestration Layer
1. Advanced technologies that protect data privacy, including techniques like Multi-Party Computation and Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
2. By facilitating the integration and coordination of multiple PETs, allowing them to work together based on their individual strengths.
3. PET Orchestration layer
4. Because different PETs have different strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different use cases.
